Most of the snippets were written by me. On the other hand, a lot of the commands are stuff I found around the web and in other bundles.

Some of the content of this bundle WILL conflict with official ones. For instance, the "Insert New Line Before" macro will conflict with a macro in the Text bundle (they have the same key trigger).
